# Batch System - Web Developer Internship Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Batch System project! This project demonstrates my skills in web development using pure HTML and CSS. It is a part of my application for an internship as a web developer. The project aims to showcase a user-friendly and simple UI as it was given in task.

## Features

- **Clean and Simple UI**: A clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and usability.
- **Pure HTML and CSS**: The project is built entirely using HTML and CSS, showcasing my proficiency in these core web technologies.

## Changes and Improvements

### Removal of LocomotiveJS

Initially, I integrated LocomotiveJS to implement smooth scrolling throughout the web pages. However, I encountered some issues with its performance and compatibility. After thorough testing and evaluation, I decided to remove LocomotiveJS to ensure a smoother and more consistent user experience. This decision highlights my ability to make critical technical decisions for the betterment of the project.
